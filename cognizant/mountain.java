// You are a part of mountain expedition team analysing the altitude changes during your journey.
// Each checkpoint you pass is recorded with an altitude value and the expedition team wants to find 
// the highestpeak encountered during the trek.A peak is declined as a sequence of altitudes that 
// first strictly increases,reahces a summit(the highest point),and then strictly decreases.
// The peak must have at least three checkpoints:
// * The first one where the altitude is increasing
// * the second one representing the summit
// * the last one where the altitude is decreasing

// You are given an integer array A of size N where each element represents the altitude at a checkpoint.
// Your task is to help the team find and return an integer value representing the maximum altitude sum 
// of any peak array during the trek.
// 
// INPUT SPECIFICATION
// input1: An integer N representing the number of checkpints during the trek.
// input2: An integer array a,where each element represents the altitude at a checkpoint.
//
// Output Specification
// Return an integer value representing the maximum altitude sum of any peak subarray during the trek
//
// Example 1:
// input1: 7
// input2: {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}
//
// output : 16
//
// Example 2:
// input1: 8
// input2: {5,1,2,3,2,1,6,7}
//
// output : 9
